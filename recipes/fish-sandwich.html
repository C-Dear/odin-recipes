			<h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepare the tartar sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, pickles and pickle brine, shallot, dill, capers and soy sauce. Season with salt to taste and set aside. Makes 3/4 of a cup.</li>
				<li>Prepare the fried fish: Heat oil in a large, straight-sided skillet over medium. Place flour, eggs and panko in 3 separate medium shallow bowls. Season flounder on both sides with salt and dredge in flour, dusting off excess, then transfer to egg wash, allow excess to drip off, then coat with panko.</li>
				<li>Working in batches, fry about 4 breaded fillets at a time until golden brown and cooked through, about 1Â½ minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack and season with salt. Repeat with remaining fish.</li>
				<li>Assemble the sandwiches: Spread tartar sauce on both sides of each bun. Place 1 piece of fried fish on each bottom bun, then add a slice of cheese on top and another piece of fish on the cheese. The residual heat from the fish will help melt the cheese. Sandwich together and serve immediately.</li>
