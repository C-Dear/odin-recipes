			<h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Gather ingredients</li>
				<li>Create meat mixture by combining the ground meat with salt, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, oregano, garlic, red onion, and lemon juice inside a mixing bowl.</li>
				<li>Divide the mixture into founr equal portions and shape into oblong patties about three inches wide by siz inches long, and a half of an inch thick. The oblong shape helps it fit inside the flatbread. Refrigerate the patties for one hour.</li>
				<li>Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. You can also use a skillet.</li>
				<li>If grilling, brush the grill or pan with oil. If you are instead pan-frying, add just a dollop of oil into the pan. Grill or fry the patties for three or four minutes per side, or until cooked through with crispy edges.</li>
				<li>Spread Tzatziki sauce down in the center of a flatbread round or the pocked of the pita.</li>
				<li>Add a lettuce leaf, some sliced tomato, and a few thin onion slices to the bread.</li>
				<li>Add the patty and fold the bread around all the ingredients. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Serve and enjoy.</li>
